	<p><span class="click" id="0">Hey.</span></p>
	<p><span id="1">I'm Woo. </span></p>
	<p><span id="2">However way you stumbled upon this website...</span></p>
	<p><span id="3">I want you to stay for a bit. </span></p>
	<p><span id="4">Take a minute off your day.</span></p>
	<p><span id="5">I want to share something I think is important.</span></p>
	<p><span id="6">Whether you're in school, working, or just hanging about, we are all in this journey to find ourselves.</span></p>
	<p><span id="7">Sometimes, we can get caught up in our own lives...</span></p>
	<p>
		<span id="8">the final exam next week... </span> 
		<span id="8.1">looming project deadline... </span> 
		<span id="8.2">what to eat tomorrow...</span>
	</p>
	<p><span id="9">It's easy to feel unsure. It's easy to feel rushed.</span></p>
	<p><span id="10">It's easy to be overwhelmed.</span></p>
	<p>
		<span id="11">Yet, we forget how easy it is to... </span> <span id="11.1">take it slow.</span>
	</p>
	<p><span id="12">I get it, some of us are in a rush to achieve our goals...	</span></p>
	<p><span id="13">I'm a University student with ambitions. </span></p>
	<p><span id="14">Ambitions that were only fueled by my failure to secure my first internship. </span></p>
	<p><span id="15">Spending every day working, making sure I don't make the same mistake. </span></p>
	<p><span id="16">Still... I have no guarantee of achieving my goals...</span></p>
	<p><span id="17">And that's ok. </span></p>
	<p><span id="18">I did something. </span></p>
	<p><span id="19">We're only human, we can only do so much. </span></p>
	<p><span id="20">So, rather than think about what you haven't done, </span></p>
	<p><span id="21">I want you to think about what you have done. </span></p>
	<p><span id="22">There is no guarantee that everything will work out. </span></p>
	<p><span id="23">And that's ok. </span></p>
	<p><span id="24">You did something. </span></p>
